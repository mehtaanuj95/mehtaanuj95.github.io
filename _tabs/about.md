Currently, I'm a Web Solutions Engineer at Google, where I work on developing tools and applications that empower business stakeholders. I work as a full stack engineer, using Typescript and Angular for the frontend and Java for the backend.


Before Google, I was working as a software engineer at SAP Labs. There, I played a key role in creating an Analytical List Page, empowering users to manage and analyze data through visualizations, graphs, and insightful drill-down functionalities. Additionally, I contributed to the development of web plugins and processes that streamline the execution of web applications within SAP's WebIDE.


Beyond my core responsibilities, I also worked part time for a few months developing speech recognition system (with a focus on Trigger word detection). The system was trained on 200 hrs of multi-accented speech data, thus allowing it to recognise if a word has ben spoken in a variety of accents. With the above project, I tool part in SAP 1BL, an initiative driven by SAP aimed at development of tools and technologies which could bring collaboration between social enterprises, corporates & consumers to accelerate social change. Our team won the nation wide competition, Innvent, thus representing India at Asia pacific qualifiers at Singapore which also we ended up winning.


Apart from this, in my free time, I often write technical blogs (see one [here](https://github.com/mehtaanuj95/photometric-frequency-analysis) ), make pet projects, play chess! I also have a deep interest in astronomy, and hence love taking a variety of online courses on coursera about it.
